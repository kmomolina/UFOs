# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create a dynamic table that was both visually pleasing as well as functional. I took UFO sighting information from a data array with more than 1000 lines of code. The table would accept input from users and then filter the data and return the filtered answerset. Any user could filter by date, cit, state, country, and shape.
